# Supervised-Classification-Project-on-Iris-Dataset


**Description:**

In this project, I've explored supervised classification techniques using the well-known Iris dataset. The main objective is to classify iris flowers into different species based on their features. To accomplish this task, I've employed various classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Logistic Regression. Additionally, I've implemented k-Means Clustering for further exploration.

**Project Highlights:**

- **Dataset:** The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing measurements of sepal and petal length and width for three different iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

- **Classification Algorithms:**
  - **Decision Trees:** A versatile algorithm that partitions the dataset into branches based on the most significant features.
  - **Random Forest:** An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
  - **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A simple yet effective instance-based classifier.
  - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC):** A powerful algorithm for finding hyperplanes that best separate data points.
  - **Logistic Regression:** A linear classifier commonly used for binary classification tasks.

- **K-Means Clustering:** I've implemented k-Means clustering to explore the data's natural grouping patterns, providing additional insights into the Iris dataset.

- **Data Preprocessing:** I've handled any missing values, performed feature scaling if necessary, and encoded categorical labels for compatibility with classification algorithms.

- **Model Evaluation:** Each classifier is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are used to ensure reliable model performance assessment.

- **Visualizations:** I've included informative visualizations, such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and scatterplots, to better understand the results and the relationships within the data.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid search and cross-validation are applied to fine-tune the models, optimizing their performance.

- **Conclusion:** The project concludes by summarizing the findings, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each classifier, and providing insights into the dataset's characteristics.
